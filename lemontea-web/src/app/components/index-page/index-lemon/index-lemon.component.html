    <h2>WHAT IS LEMON TEA?</h2>
    <p>Lemon tea is one of our favorite blends for a refreshing, healthy citrus sip. There are tons of different types
        of
        lemon teas to try, whether it’s a tea blend already pre-flavored with citrus or lemon peel, or a lemon tea you
        make
        yourself with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Even certain herbs like lemon verbena and lemon balm add a zesty,
        sweet aroma and taste to any type of tea.</p>
    <p>Lemon tea is delicious any time of day, but we recommend drinking lemon tea in the morning for a refreshing start
        to
        your day. Lemon tea can also be sipped in the evening or after meals as a palate cleanser, but make sure that
        the
        type of base tea in your lemon tea blend has little-to-no caffeine! Plus, tea with
        honey and lemon is an effective home remedy for sore throats and colds.
